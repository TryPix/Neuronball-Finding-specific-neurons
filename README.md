# Neuronball-Finding-Specific-neurons

Neuronball is an online multiplayer game where two teams of 5 "neurons" face of in a football style simulation. Each neuron has a name, which usually composed of a prefix and suffix. There are a large amount of these prefix-suffix combinations, and the goal is to find Neurons with a specific prefix name, by crawling through all the neurons.

Each neuron is uniquely indexed by an id, and can be found on {neuronball.com/player/NEURON_ID/}.
